(** Logs reporter via syslog using Lwt and TLS

    Please read {!Logs_syslog} first. *)

(** [tcp_tls_reporter ~hostname remote_ip ~port ~cacert ~cert ~priv_key ~framing
    ()] is [Ok reporter] or [Error msg].  The TLS connection validates the
    certificate of the log server, it must be signed by [cacert].  The reporters
    credentials are its public [cert], and its [priv_key].  The [reporter] sends
    each log message to [remote_ip, port] via TLS.  If the initial TLS
    connection to the [remote_ip] fails, an [Error msg] is returned instead.  If
    the TLS connection fails, the log message is reported to standard error, and
    an attempt is made to re-establish the TLS connection.  Each message is
    prepended by its length, encoded as decimal integer, as specified in
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5125}RFC 5125}.  The default value for
    [hostname] is [Lwt_unix.gethostname ()], the default value for [port] is
    6514, [framing] appends a 0 byte by default. *)

(** {1:lwt_tls_example Example usage}

    To install a Lwt syslog reporter, sending via TLS to localhost, use the
    following snippet (assuming you already have certificates, and the common
    name of the collector is "log server"):
{[
let install_logger () =
  tls_reporter (Unix.inet_addr_of_string "127.0.0.1")
    ~cacert:"ca.pem" ~cert:"log.pem" ~priv_key:"log.key"
    () >|= function
  | Ok r -> Logs.set_reporter r
  | Error e -> print_endline e

let _ = Lwt_main.run (install_logger ())
]}
